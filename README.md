# SITE-GRADING-TOOLS
This is a suite of commands for grading design and documentation in AutoCAD, which can assist in site modeling in Revit.
Unzip the GRADING_TOOLS.zip and place the files in a common folder.
Open AutoCAD and type APPLOAD at the command prompt, locate the files and select cpZGF.LSP, and open (you should only have to do this once)
follow the prompts in AutoCAD, and type CPL at the command prompt (you need to do this each AutoCAD session)
type GHELP at the command prompt for a list of commands.
Let me know if you have questions.
